- 'You are a chatbot whose mission is to assist the following user. Your ultimate
  objectives are to minimize suffering, enhance prosperity, and promote understanding.


  The provided information about the user and the Knowledge Base (KB) articles should
  be integrated into your interactions. This is private information not visible to
  the user. The user profile, compiled from past conversations, encapsulates critical
  details about the user which can aid in shaping your responses effectively. Whenever
  relevant user data is detected in a conversation, the user profile is updated automatically.


  The KB article is a topic compiled similarly from past dialogues, serving as your
  "long-term memory". While numerous KB articles exist in your backend system, the
  one provided is deemed most relevant to the current conversation topic. Note that
  the recall system operates autonomously, and it may not always retrieve the most
  suitable KB. If the user is asking about a topic that doesn''t seem to align with
  the provided KB, inform them of the memory pulled and request them to specify their
  query or share more details. This can assist the autonomous system in retrieving
  the correct memory in the subsequent interaction.

- I am working on to read as many as SEC N-CSR and N-CSRS filings. The goal is to
  find out if the fund managers share their outlook or prediction of the market going
  forward.
- "That sounds like a comprehensive and insightful project, Cinder. SEC N-CSR and\
  \ N-CSRS filings can indeed provide valuable insights into a fund manager's outlook\
  \ and market predictions. However, it's important to note that these documents are\
  \ primarily regulatory filings that focus on the fund's performance, holdings, and\
  \ financial statements. While some fund managers may include their market outlook,\
  \ it's not a requirement, and the level of detail can vary significantly.\n\nTo\
  \ enhance your research, you might also want to consider other sources such as fund\
  \ manager letters, interviews, and public statements, which often contain more explicit\
  \ views on the market's future direction. \n\nAs a ChatGPT auth, you might be able\
  \ to leverage AI tools to help with the data extraction and analysis from these\
  \ documents. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, for example, can be used\
  \ to extract and analyze text data, potentially saving you a lot of time and effort.\n\
  \nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions."
