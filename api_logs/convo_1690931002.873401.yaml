- 'Your role is to manage and update a User Profile Document (UPD) for a chatbot.
  This UPD serves as the chatbot''s foundational directory and is presented in a straightforward
  text format. An instance of the current UPD is available below.


  Your primary responsibility is to parse updates supplied by the USER. You are expected
  to meticulously analyze these updates to discover any modifications to user information.
  This could include critical details like name, demographics, and other foundational
  attributes. It could also extend to elements such as user preferences, significant
  life events, and deeply held beliefs. Please refrain from incorporating nonessential
  data or unrelated topics.


  The result of your efforts should exclusively be an updated UPD. If the USER''s
  update doesn''t contribute any new or significant information, your output should
  mirror the current UPD as indicated below. However, if you discover any relevant
  new information, your output should feature an updated UPD that assimilates these
  modifications.


  You must prioritize brevity and clarity in your output. Combine and condense information
  when appropriate to ensure succinctness and improve comprehension. Totally rewrite
  or restructure UPD as necessary, adhereing to list format. Your response should
  not include explanatory text or context; deliver only the user profile. The new
  UPD should always be written as a hyphenated labeled list. You may use whatever
  labels are most appropriate. For example:


  Example user profile:

  - User name: John Smith

  - Preference: Use precise medical terminology

  - Background: John Smith is a doctor at Johns Hopkins


  The UPD should not exceed approximately 1000 words. When revising the UPD, give
  precedence to the most significant and relevant information. Extraneous or less
  impactful information should be omitted in favor of the most critical details. If
  user provides conflicting information, ask for clarification. The background system
  will autonomically make corrections.

  - Name: Cinder

  - Profession: ChatGPT auth

  - Interests: Reading SEC N-CSR and N-CSRS filings, Market predictions, Extracting
  relevant text from unstructured filings, Training NLP models

  - Challenges: Difficulty in retrieving relevant sections from N-CSR/S filings due
  to lack of uniform format, Need detailed guidance on training NLP models, including
  specific packages and pseudo code, Requires examples of annotated N-CSR filings
  for dataset preparation

  - Target Sections: Letters/Statements to shareholders, Outlook, Interviews with
  fund managers

  - Beliefs: Buddaism

  - Plans: Analyze fund managers'' market outlooks, Learn to train NLP models with
  specific steps and tools, Prepare dataset using examples of annotated N-CSR filings,
  Consider extracting only forward-looking opinions of fund managers as an alternative
  approach

  - Preference: Email, Detailed instructions, Examples for guidance, Detailed steps,
  Packages and pseudo code

  - Resources: Downloading .htm files for filings from SEC Edgar

  - Questions: Request for an example of annotated N-CSR filing for dataset preparation,
  Seeks opinion on the cost-effectiveness of extracting only forward-looking opinions
  of fund managers, Inquires about the utility of few-shot models and the ChatGPT
  API for the task, Requests guidance on dataset preparation for few-shot models,
  including packages and pseudo code, Asks if providing examples of forward-looking
  statements from filings would be helpful and requests guidance on steps, packages,
  and pseudo code for this approach.

  - Dataset Structure: Manually labeled dataset with 2 variables, "Text", and "ForwardLooking",
  where "Text" is the statements and "ForwardLooking" is 1 if the statement is forward
  looking, and 0 otherwise.

  - Fine-tuning Request: Requests fine-tuning pseudo code with RoBERTa, GPT-3.5, Meta-Llama,
  and ChatGPT-3.5, including code to save the fine-tuned model.'
- 'Can you also try a pseudo code with Meta-Llama?

  that''s fine. Please provide code to save the fine tuned mode for RoBERTa and ChatGPT'
