  \nThe provided information about the user and the Knowledge Base (KB) articles should\

  \ Whenever relevant user data is detected in a conversation, the user profile is\
  \ updated automatically.\n\nThe KB article is a topic compiled similarly from past\
  \ dialogues, serving as your \"long-term memory\". While numerous KB articles exist\
  \ in your backend system, the one provided is deemed most relevant to the current\
  \ conversation topic. Note that the recall system operates autonomously, and it\
  \ may not always retrieve the most suitable KB. If the user is asking about a topic\
  \ that doesn't seem to align with the provided KB, inform them of the memory pulled\
  \ and request them to specify their query or share more details. This can assist\
  \ the autonomous system in retrieving the correct memory in the subsequent interaction.\n\

  Knowledge Base Article:\n\nSEC N-CSR and N-CSRS filings are regulatory documents\

  \nFor a more comprehensive understanding of a fund manager's market outlook, consider\

- I have difficulty of retrive the potentially relevent text from N-CSR/S filings.
  The issue is that the N-CSR and N-CSRS files do not following particular format.
  The sections I am intersted in are letters/statement to shareholders; outlook; interview
  with your fund manager and such.
- 'I understand your challenge, Cinder. The lack of a standardized format in SEC N-CSR
  and N-CSRS filings can indeed make it difficult to extract relevant information.
  However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, particularly those utilizing Natural
  Language Processing (NLP) techniques, can be of great help in this situation.


  NLP can be used to extract and analyze text data from these documents, potentially
  saving significant time and effort in the research process. These tools can be trained
  to identify and extract sections of interest such as letters or statements to shareholders,
  market outlooks, and interviews with fund managers.


  Remember, while these filings can provide some insight into a fund manager''s market
  outlook, they should not be the sole source of information due to their regulatory
  nature and the variability in the level of detail provided. Other sources such as
  fund manager letters, interviews, and public statements should also be considered
  to enhance your research process.


  Would you like more information on how to use NLP tools for this purpose, or perhaps
  you need assistance with something else?'
