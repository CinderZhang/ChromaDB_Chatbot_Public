Yes, providing examples of forward-looking statements from the filings would be very helpful. These examples can be used to train your model in a few-shot learning setup. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Data Preparation**: Gather a small number of examples of forward-looking statements from your filings. Each example should include the full text of the statement and the start and end indices of the forward-looking part.

2. **Model Selection**: Choose a model that's suitable for few-shot learning. GPT-3 or GPT-Neo are good choices for this task. You can use the Hugging Face's Transformers library to access these models.

3. **Training**: Prepare your prompt and examples, and use them to generate a response from the model. The model should be able to identify the forward-looking statements in your examples.

Here's a simplified example using Python and the Hugging Face's Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import GPTNeoForCausalLM, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPTNeoForCausalLM.from_pretrained('EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B')

# Prepare your prompt and examples
prompt = "In the following text, identify the forward-looking statements:"
examples = [
    ("The market has been volatile, but we expect it to stabilize in the coming months.", "we expect it to stabilize in the coming months"),
    ("Our fund has performed well this year and we anticipate continued growth.", "we anticipate continued growth"),
    # Add more examples from your filings
]

# Concatenate your prompt and examples into a single string
input_text = prompt + "\n\n" + "\n\n".join(f"Text: {text}\nStatement: {statement}" for text, statement in examples)

# Tokenize your input text
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt')

# Generate a response from the model
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)

# Decode the response
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])

# The response should contain the forward-looking statements from your new text
```

This is a very simplified example and the actual code may vary depending on your specific needs. I recommend checking out the Hugging Face's Transformers documentation and tutorials for more information.

Remember, few-shot learning can be very effective, but it's not guaranteed to work perfectly, especially on complex tasks like this. It's important to evaluate your model's performance and adjust your approach as needed.
