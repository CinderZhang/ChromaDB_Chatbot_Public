I understand your challenge, Cinder. The lack of a standardized format in SEC N-CSR and N-CSRS filings can indeed make it difficult to extract relevant information. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, particularly those utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, can be of great help in this situation.

NLP can be used to extract and analyze text data from these documents, potentially saving significant time and effort in the research process. These tools can be trained to identify and extract sections of interest such as letters or statements to shareholders, market outlooks, and interviews with fund managers.

Remember, while these filings can provide some insight into a fund manager's market outlook, they should not be the sole source of information due to their regulatory nature and the variability in the level of detail provided. Other sources such as fund manager letters, interviews, and public statements should also be considered to enhance your research process.

Would you like more information on how to use NLP tools for this purpose, or perhaps you need assistance with something else?
