That sounds like a comprehensive and insightful project, Cinder. SEC N-CSR and N-CSRS filings can indeed provide valuable insights into a fund manager's outlook and market predictions. However, it's important to note that these documents are primarily regulatory filings that focus on the fund's performance, holdings, and financial statements. While some fund managers may include their market outlook, it's not a requirement, and the level of detail can vary significantly.

To enhance your research, you might also want to consider other sources such as fund manager letters, interviews, and public statements, which often contain more explicit views on the market's future direction. 

As a ChatGPT auth, you might be able to leverage AI tools to help with the data extraction and analysis from these documents. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, for example, can be used to extract and analyze text data, potentially saving you a lot of time and effort.
