I'm sorry for any confusion, but as of now, Meta-Llama is not a specific model that's available in popular libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers or in the OpenAI API. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication about the model name.

If you're referring to a specific model or library, could you please provide more details or clarify? I'd be happy to help with more accurate information once I understand better.
