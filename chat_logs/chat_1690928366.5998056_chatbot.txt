Fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 model specifically is not currently supported in the Hugging Face's Transformers library. However, you can use the GPT-3.5 model via OpenAI's API for text generation tasks. 

For classification tasks like yours, you would typically use the model to generate text based on a prompt and then post-process the generated text to get your classification. Here's a simplified example:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Prepare your prompt
prompt = "This is a forward-looking statement:"

# Add your examples
examples = [
    ("The market has been volatile, but we expect it to stabilize in the coming months.", "True"),
    ("Our fund has performed well this year.", "False"),
    # Add more examples
]

# Concatenate your prompt and examples into a single string
input_text = prompt + "\n\n" + "\n\n".join(f"Text: {text}\nForward-looking: {forward_looking}" for text, forward_looking in examples)

# Generate a response from the model
response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-003", prompt=input_text, max_tokens=100)

# The response should contain whether your new text is a forward-looking statement or not
```

This is a very simplified example and the actual code may vary depending on your specific needs. I recommend checking out the OpenAI API documentation for more information.

Remember, using the GPT-3.5 model in this way is not the same as fine-tuning the model on your task. The model is generating text based on the patterns it learned during its pre-training, and it's not being updated to better fit your specific task.
