Sure, Cinder. Here's a more detailed guide using Python and the Hugging Face's Transformers library, which provides pre-trained models like BERT and GPT. This is a simplified example and the actual code may vary depending on your specific needs.

1. **Data Preparation**: Convert your .htm files into plain text. You can use BeautifulSoup for this:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def html_to_text(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')
    return soup.get_text()
```

2. **Annotation**: Manually annotate a subset of your data. This involves marking the start and end of the sections of interest in your text. There are tools like Doccano that can help with this. The output should be a list of tuples, each containing the start and end indices of a section.

3. **Model Selection**: Import a pre-trained model and a tokenizer from the Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizerFast, BertForTokenClassification

tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```

4. **Training**: Prepare your data for training. Tokenize your text and labels, and split your data into training and validation sets. Then, fine-tune your model:

```python
# Tokenize your text and labels
inputs = tokenizer(texts, is_split_into_words=True, padding=True, truncation=True)
labels = [...]  # Your annotated labels

# Split your data into training and validation sets
train_inputs, val_inputs, train_labels, val_labels = train_test_split(inputs, labels)

# Fine-tune your model
model.train()
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate your model's performance on your validation set:

```python
model.eval()
for batch in val_dataloader:
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**batch)
    # Calculate your performance metric
```

6. **Deployment**: Use your trained model to extract sections from new filings:

```python
def extract_sections(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    # Post-process the outputs to get the start and end indices of the sections
```

This is a very simplified example and there are many details not covered here, such as how to handle the labels, how to calculate the performance metric, and how to post-process the model's outputs. I recommend checking out the Hugging Face's Transformers documentation and tutorials for more information.
